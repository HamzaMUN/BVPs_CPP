# Numerical Solutions for Boundary Value Problems (using C++):

## Introduction
Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) are essential in mathematical modelling across various fields. This report demonstrates numerical solutions to BVPs using C++, including error analysis and matrix formulation.  

This repository has the projects with the following tasks:  
1. Generate uniformly spaced points in the interval [a, b] with N interior points,
2. Use finite difference methods (forward, backward, central and extrapolated central) to approximate first-order solutions,
3. Generate the tridiagonal matrix (M) and RHS vector (F) for solving the BVP u'' = f(x), and
4. Approximate the solutions to the BVP u'' = f(x) and compare it with the exact solution.
