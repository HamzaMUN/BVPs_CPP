## Generate uniformly spaced points in the interval [a, b] with N interior points
### Comments on results:
We chose an interval from -2 to 10 with 10 interior points. If we see the results, we can verify that our grid includes -2 and 10, i.e., boundary values. Other than boundary values, there are 10 interior points, i.e., 12 points in total, including boundary points. Another thing we can verify is that these points are uniformly spaced (The difference between the two grid points in the mesh is the same).
