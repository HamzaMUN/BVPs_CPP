## Generate the tridiagonal matrix (M) and RHS vector (F) for solving the BVP u'' = f(x)
### Problem setup:
$$u'' = f(x), \quad u(0) = A, \quad u(1) = B$$  
Let's take a simple function $f(x) = 2x$ and boundary conditions as $A = 0$ and $B = 1$.  
For $N = 10$, the grid points are $x_j = \frac {j}{N + 1}$, where $j = 0, 1, 2,...,N$.  
The grid spacing is: $h = \frac {b - a}{N + 1} = \frac {1}{N + 1} = \frac {1}{11} \approx 0.09090909$  
The grid points will be: $x_0 = 0, x_1 = 0.09090909, x_2 = 0.18181818,...,x_10 = 1$  
The centered finite difference approximation for the second derivative $u''(x)$ at grid points $x_j$ is:
$$u''(x_j) \approx \frac {1}{h^2} (u_{j-1} - 2u_j + u_{j+1})$$  
For each interior grid point $j = 1, 2,...,N-1$, the equation becomes:  
$$\frac {1}{h^2} (u_{j-1} - 2u_j + u_{j+1}) = f(x_j)$$  
Since $f(x) = 2x$, we have:  
$$f(x_j) = 2x_j = 2. \frac {j}{N + 1}$$  
for $j = 1,2,...N-1$  
The system can be written in matrix form as $M.U = F$, where matrix M is an $ N \times N$ tridiagonal matrix with main diagonal: $\frac{-2}{h^2}$ and off-diagonal: $\frac {1}{h^2}$, wheras vector F is a vector of size N:  
$$F = 
\begin{bmatrix}
f(x_1) - \frac{A}{h^2} \\
f(x_2) \\
\vdots \\
f(x_{N-1}) \\
f(x_N) - \frac{B}{h^2}
\end{bmatrix}$$  
where $f(x_j) = 2x_j$. This gives:  
$$F = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac {2}{N + 1} \\
\frac {4}{N + 1} \\
\vdots \\
\frac {2N}{N + 1}
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Comments on results:
The results for $N = 10$ show that the matrix M generated by the code is a $10 \times 10$ matrix. The primary and off-diagonals of the matrix are calculated correctly, and the given vector F is of size 10 with boundary conditions implemented in it, i.e., $A = 0$ and $B = 1$.
